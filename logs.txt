our goals are:
determine if the problem is worth solving. so we asked people if they find it hard to move or find someone who can move their staff safely and fast.  and while I am doing this I also asked another question "tell me about the last time you moved something heavy or from two far distances" and then I got a lot of data a lot of complaints that can be our core features. but I really like to get our main feature from the potential customer itself so I said "What do you think could be done to help you with moving things?".
after hearing about they pain it was time to show the cure. would our service going to solve this problem and how much can you pay for it? and  I said what do you think about our service and "Would you be willing to start using this right away"? and finally asked "What could be done to improve this product?"
